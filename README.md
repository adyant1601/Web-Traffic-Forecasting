Developed a forecasting model to predict future web traffic values for Wikipedia pages using Time Series
Analysis. Applied the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test to ensure data stationarity and removed Seasonality and
Trend components to conduct residual analysis followed by Statistical Techniques to further stabilize the series.
Implemented the ARIMA model by determining optimal parameters (p, d, q) throughACF and PACF plots.
Additionally, utilized LSTM networks for long term dependencies and created an ensemble model combining both
approaches to get better estimates.
